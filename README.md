# Research on APT Attack Detection Using Provenance Graph Analysis and TTP-Based Threat Intelligence

## 📌 Introduction

This project focuses on detecting **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)** by analyzing system-level provenance data and incorporating **TTP-based threat intelligence** from MITRE ATT&CK and real-world CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) reports. The goal is to improve APT detection by combining low-level event tracking with high-level semantic threat behaviors.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Reconstruct provenance graphs** from system audit logs.
- **Label and abstract system behaviors** into TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) using a rule-based mapping approach.
- **Extract real-world TTPs** from CTI reports (PDF or text format) using natural language processing.
- **Train graph neural networks (GNNs)** such as R-GCN or GAT to detect suspicious behavior patterns by matching them to known TTP sequences.
