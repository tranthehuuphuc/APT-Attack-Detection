ready-to-use content packs that automate common operational workflows across the environment. December 29, 2025 | Michael Devins | Endpoint Security & XDR As IT environments grow more complex and adversaries move faster, security and IT teams need a reliable way to enforce configurations, maintain application health, and resolve issues at scale without writing or maintaining custom scripts. CrowdStrike Falcon® for IT already gives operators powerful tools to query endpoints, run remediation, and enforce baseline configurations. Turnkey automations, a new feature in Falcon for IT, build on this foundation, delivering ready-to-use content packs that automate common operational workflows across the environment. All content packs run through the existing Falcon sensor, allowing teams to automate common operational workflows across the environment. Together, these capabilities give teams a faster, more reliable way to keep endpoints healthy and secure at scale. These content packs span multiple categories including application resilience, file discovery, Linux device control, and asset and configuration management. New packs are added regularly through CrowdStrike-built and partner-contributed content. Now generally available, these new capabilities include: Application resilience content packs (e.g., SCCM, Fortinet) File indexing content packs Linux device control and operational content packs Dashboards for monitoring pack activity and remediation outcomes By eliminating manual scripting and providing prebuilt automation across these workflows, turnkey automations help teams enforce consistent configurations, reduce operational overhead, and accelerate response from within the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. Application Resilience Packs Maintain Critical Application Health Every organization relies on core applications such as endpoint protection, VPN, DLP, and backup clients. These applications must remain healthy for security and operations to function effectively. When they drift from policy or stop running, visibility gaps appear, investigations slow, and risk increases. Falcon for IT already lets operators define expected endpoint state and enforce it when drift occurs. Application resilience content packs extend this capability by delivering prebuilt baseline enforcement as an automated workflow. Operators import a pack from the Content Library, assign it to host groups, and the Falcon sensor performs continuous health checks in the background. These packs validate whether an application is installed correctly, running as expected, and passing required health checks. If a service stops, a file changes, or an application falls out of policy, the pack automatically restarts or reinstalls the application to restore the expected state. This happens without custom scripts or additional deployment overhead. CrowdStrike-built and partner-contributed packs such as those from SCCM and Fortinet extend the operational coverage teams can enforce out of the box. With baseline enforcement delivered as a turnkey workflow, teams maintain consistent application uptime and reduce the effort required to troubleshoot agent failures across large, distributed fleets. Figure 1. Application resilience content packs, including partner integrations such as those with Fortinet, available in the Falcon for IT Content Library File Indexing Packs Accelerate Investigations Investigations often hinge on how quickly teams can confirm whether a file exists, where it resides, or whether it has changed. Traditional approaches like manual scans, ad hoc queries, or custom scripts are slow, inconsistent, and disruptive to endpoints. File indexing content packs provide a ready-to-use workflow that builds and maintains a local file index on each endpoint. Operators select which directories to include, define exclusions, and schedule indexing windows so activity runs during off-hours. The packs use built-in performance guardrails and update indexes incrementally, capturing only new or modified files to minimize system impact. When analysts need to validate an indicator of compromise, confirm policy enforcement, or locate sensitive data, they can conduct searches to run against these local indexes instead of triggering a live scan. This delivers rapid results across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments, even at enterprise scale. As coverage expands across more hosts and file paths, teams gain a continuously updated view of file activity that accelerates investigations and eliminates the need for custom osquery or manual scanning workflows. Figure 2. File indexing dashboards showing coverage, scheduling status, and pack activity within Falcon for IT Operational Content Packs Automate Device Control and Everyday Tasks Many operational tasks, such as managing USB device policies on Linux, maintaining accurate asset inventories, or applying consistent configuration checks, require repeated and often manual effort across large endpoint fleets. These workflows frequently rely on custom scripts or fragmented tools that are difficult to scale and maintain. Operational content packs help teams automate these tasks through the Falcon sensor already running on each endpoint. Capabilities that once required deploying and managing separate endpoint management agents can now be delivered through the existing Falcon platform footprint, reducing agent sprawl and operational complexity. Operators import the appropriate pack and apply it to targeted host groups, and the pack executes the defined checks or enforcement actions on a recurring schedule. Because the packs run locally with built-in guardrails, they provide consistent, low-overhead automation that scales cleanly across diverse environments. Linux device control packs, for example, allow teams to enforce USB policies and monitor device activity across Linux hosts. Other packs support inventory management, configuration validation, and additional operational checks that benefit from standardized execution at scale. By replacing manual processes with automated, sensor-driven workflows, teams can reduce configuration drift, improve response consistency, and maintain tighter operational control across diverse environments. This removes much of the overhead associated with building, testing, and maintaining custom scripts. Figure 3. Linux device control and operational content packs available in the Falcon for IT Content Library Measure Automation Impact with Built-In Dashboards Dashboards in Falcon for IT give teams clear visibility into how content packs perform across their environment. They track pack activity, remediation outcomes, and endpoint health, helping operators understand where automation is working, where drift is occurring, and where follow-up may be needed. Teams use these dashboards to validate remediation, investigate outliers, and share operational updates across security and IT without building custom reports or maintaining separate monitoring tools. Because dashboards draw directly from Falcon sensor telemetry, they provide consistent, real-time insight into the state of automated enforcement and workflow execution. As organizations deploy additional packs, dashboards expand the operational picture and make it easier to maintain consistent enforcement across large, distributed fleets. This creates a repeatable lifecycle: Packs enforce the desired state, dashboards surface the results, and teams can take targeted follow-up actions where needed. This closed-loop model strengthens operational consistency and reduces the effort required to maintain endpoint health at scale. Figure 4.

Powered by the Falcon sensor and delivered through a growing library of content packs, these workflows help IT and SecOps operate with greater speed and confidence, all from a single platform built to stop breaches.
