Alert Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer Last Revised February 02, 2004 Alert Code SA04-033A Systems Affected Microsoft Windows systems running Internet Explorer 5.01 Internet Explorer 5.50 Internet Explorer 6 Previous versions that are no longer supported may also be affected. Overview Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) contains multiple vulnerabilities, the most serious of which could allow attackers in any location to run programs of their choice on your computer using the same privileges as you have. Quick Links Patch Information | Problem Description | References Description Microsoft's Home User Security Bulletin for February 2004 describes three vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer (IE). Note that in addition to IE, any applications that use IE to interpret HTML documents, such as email programs, may present additional ways for these vulnerabilities to be used. These vulnerabilities have different impacts, ranging from disguising the true location of a URL to executing computer commands or code, essentially taking over control of your computer and any data on it. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing you, the victim, to access a specially crafted HTML document such as a web page or HTML email message. Your computer can be compromised simply by viewing the attacker's HTML document with Internet Explorer. A technical description of these vulnerabilities is available from US-CERT in TA04-033A and from Microsoft in MS04-004 . Resolution Apply a patch Microsoft has released a home user bulletin describing how to determine what patches you will need and how to get them. Follow the procedures outlined in Microsoft's Home User Security Bulletin for February 2004 . For additional information, and to receive updates on this alert, go to http://www.us-cert.gov .
