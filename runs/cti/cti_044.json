efficiency gains, and faster protection with AI-native endpoint security. December 17, 2025 | Dana Larson | Endpoint Security & XDR Organizations are under pressure to protect more devices, users, and distributed workloads than ever — while adversaries are moving faster, smarter, and across more domains. Many businesses still depend on complex solutions that create gaps between tools and strain security teams. CrowdStrike Endpoint Security addresses these challenges with AI-native protection delivered through a single lightweight sensor that serves as the foundation of our unified, AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform, which consolidates security capabilities, eliminates blind spots, and enables real-time visibility and automated response across every endpoint. To measure the value of this unified approach, CrowdStrike commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study assessing the business and security impact of CrowdStrike Endpoint Security. Forrester Results: 273% ROI and Payback in Under Six Months The Forrester Consulting Total Economic Impact™ study, commissioned by CrowdStrike, found organizations deploying CrowdStrike Endpoint Security achieved a 273% return on investment (ROI) over three years and recovered their investment in under six months. The study modeled a global composite organization with 15,000 employees and 12,000 endpoints to quantify the financial and operational impact of adopting CrowdStrike endpoint protection, specifically CrowdStrike Falcon® Insight XDR and CrowdStrike Falcon® Device Control. Forrester’s analysis found organizations realized significant benefits including cost savings, productivity gains, and reduced risk exposure: 80% lower risk of endpoint-related breaches through stronger protection and faster investigation and response. 95% reduction in technology management labor by eliminating multiple legacy tools and streamlining operations with a single SaaS-delivered console that requires no maintenance. 30,500+ hours saved across security and technical teams. 66% faster time to value for new sites and acquisitions. This all cumulates into a net present value of $3.7 million USD for CrowdStrike Endpoint Security. Transforming Security and Business Outcomes Before adopting CrowdStrike Endpoint Security, customers interviewed by Forrester described an environment defined by complexity and inefficiency. They struggled with legacy endpoint tools that were difficult to manage, prone to false positives, and resource-intensive to maintain — often slowing performance and delaying investigations. CrowdStrike Endpoint Security helped them address that complexity by streamlining operations, improving analyst productivity, and strengthening protection without slowing the business. With real-time telemetry, behavioral analytics, and automated response workflows, organizations gained immediate visibility into malicious activity and reduced the manual overhead associated with tuning, patching, and maintaining legacy tools. Security teams reported a dramatic reduction in alert noise and manual workload, freeing analysts to focus on threat hunting and automation rather than repetitive triage. One organization described how investigations that once took hours were now completed in minutes. Others highlighted how tool consolidation simplified management and improved system performance for end users. “CrowdStrike Endpoint Security has allowed us to speed up adoption of a security-focused culture … It is ever present, it’s always protecting you, but you almost forget it’s there because it’s never really causing you a problem.” – Director of cyberdefense, healthcare company Beyond efficiency, the study found that organizations strengthened resilience and agility. By eliminating legacy tools and accelerating endpoint integration for new sites and acquisitions, security leaders could scale confidently while maintaining consistent protection. The CrowdStrike Falcon platform’s unified design reduced friction across IT and security teams, improving collaboration and building greater trust in security across the organization. Ultimately, we believe these outcomes illustrate how CrowdStrike transforms endpoint protection from a reactive necessity into a strategic enabler — one that reduces risk, accelerates operations, and delivers measurable business value validated by independent analysis. These results reflect the core principles behind CrowdStrike Endpoint Security: AI-native detection and a single-sensor architecture, delivered from a cloud-native platform that scales seamlessly across global environments. By starting with endpoint modernization, organizations gain a unified foundation that eliminates overhead, strengthens coverage, and paves the way for a broader security strategy. Why This Matters for Security Leaders As threats accelerate and move across environments in minutes, legacy endpoint tools can no longer keep up. Security and IT leaders need solutions that eliminate blind spots and unify protection and visibility across devices, identities, cloud workloads, and data. Customers interviewed for the TEI study described how deploying CrowdStrike Endpoint Security created a foundation for simplifying operations, accelerating SOC efficiency, and improving time-to-value for growth initiatives. Many began with endpoint security, then expanded into identity protection, IT hygiene, threat intelligence, and other areas — all through the same lightweight Falcon sensor and unified platform. This approach reduces operational friction and strengthens an organization’s ability to detect and stop attacks across their environment. By modernizing the endpoint and building on a unified platform, organizations gain efficiency, resilience, and measurable ROI — empowering their teams to act faster and demonstrate value to the business. “[Our legacy provider] was very hard to manage and we wanted to go to something simpler. Then we looked at CrowdStrike, did the proof of concept, we liked it, and we decided to go all in.” – Enterprise security manager, oil & gas company Read the study to see how CrowdStrike Endpoint Security delivered measurable business impact.
