approach can help keep information safe December 11, 2025 | Jim Hoagland - Vanessa Villa | Securing AI Sensitive information disclosure ranks #2 on the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications , and for good reason. When AI-powered applications inadvertently expose private data like personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, health information, API keys, or proprietary business intelligence, the consequences cascade quickly: regulatory violations, competitive disadvantage, and shattered user trust. In this blog, we discuss the many ways AI data leaks can happen, where data is often linked to, and how a defense-in-depth approach can help protect your organization’s sensitive information. Where AI Systems Spring Leaks Application-Level Leakage Contextualization techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) create significant exposure risks . When RAG systems pull information from vector databases or knowledge stores, they often bypass the original access controls that protected the data. This is what happens: Documents are chunked and embedded into vectors, but the metadata containing access control lists often gets stripped away or ignored during retrieval. The large language model (LLM) has no way to enforce who should see what. Document-level permissions get lost in translation, and suddenly the LLM is serving up information to users who should never see it. The model becomes an inadvertent privilege escalation vector. Agentic AI systems compound these challenges. Unlike constrained LLM applications, AI agents can autonomously access multiple databases, APIs, and tools in real time based on user requests. An agent might query a customer database, call a payment processing API, access a document management system, and pull from a data warehouse all within a single conversation thread. Each tool invocation represents a potential data leak, and the agent's decision-making process about which tools to use and what data to retrieve happens dynamically, making it nearly impossible to predict or audit data flows in advance. Even more concerning, agents often chain operations together. Data retrieved from one secure system might be passed to another tool or stored in shared context, creating unintended data commingling. When an agent has broad tool access, a single prompt injection or logic flaw can cascade into widespread data exposure across multiple systems that would normally be isolated from each other. Training data presents another vulnerability. Models can memorize and regurgitate sensitive information from their training sets, and there's currently no reliable way to guarantee they won't. Add prompt injection attacks into the mix, and you have a system that can be manipulated into disclosing sensitive or private user information. User-Introduced Leakage While we often focus on technical vulnerabilities, users are another source of data exposure — and often, they don't even realize they're creating risk. The convenience of AI assistants can override security awareness, leading to dangerous patterns of oversharing. Consider document processing scenarios: An employee asks an AI to summarize a quarterly report, not realizing it contains confidential financial projections that shouldn't leave the finance department. A developer may use a coding assistant to debug a script, inadvertently sharing source code with hardcoded API keys, access tokens, or proprietary algorithms that represent years of competitive advantage. Customer service interactions present another common risk vector. Users often provide sensitive details to chatbots — Social Security numbers, credit card information, or account credentials — when simpler identifiers would suffice. They're accustomed to proving their identity to human agents and apply the same behavior to AI systems without considering where the data might end up. Email integration features, while incredibly useful for productivity, can also lead to data exposure. When users grant AI assistants access to their inboxes, those systems suddenly have visibility into data such as protected health information (PHI), privileged attorney-client communications, confidential business negotiations, and sensitive HR matters. The AI doesn't understand the sensitivity context — it just sees text to process. Where Data Gets Leaked Once sensitive information enters an AI system, it can be leaked through multiple avenues: LLM responses to other users LLM responses that are reintegrated into downstream systems Agentic tools and API calls that expose data directly or reveal information through behavioral patterns Data source queries that telegraph what information the system is accessing Debug and audit logs that capture sensitive content in plaintext Context storage where sensitive data lands in databases without appropriate security controls Cross-user contamination when one user's sensitive data bleeds into another user's context Unintended use cases that violate regulatory compliance or data handling agreements Plugging the Leaks: A Defense-in-Depth Approach Model-Level Controls Since LLMs fundamentally cannot keep secrets, training data should be carefully curated with the intended user in mind. Before expanding access to additional users, audit what information the model was trained on and whether or not certain users should have access to that data. Systematic Data Protection Implement multiple layers of defense across the AI pipeline: Identification and Classification : Automatically detect and tag sensitive information types (PII, PHI, financial data, credentials, proprietary information) Data Minimization : Block sensitive data at ingress points before it enters the system. The best way to prevent leakage is to never ingest the data in the first place. Sanitization : Cleanse data of sensitive elements while preserving the utility of that data for AI processing. Redaction : Mask or tokenize sensitive information in outputs, logs, and storage. Access Control : Enforce granular permissions that follow data through the entire AI pipeline, from retrieval to generation to storage. Apply Everywhere These protective measures need comprehensive coverage across AI infrastructure. Different components require different emphasis, but none should be neglected. Critical priority areas demand the strongest controls. User prompts and LLM outputs, where sensitive data most commonly enters and exits the system, are the primary exposure surfaces. Agent tool calls and API interactions represent autonomous data movement that happens without direct human oversight, making them particularly risky. High-priority areas include context data and RAG retrievals, where access control bypass is most likely to occur, and debug and audit logs, which often contain complete data samples in plaintext. Training and fine-tuning datasets require careful attention because they create permanent exposure risks that can't be easily remediated if exposure occurs. Standard priority areas like documents and files still need protection, but the risk is often more contained and easier to audit. However, don't let \"standard priority\" mean \"unprotected\" — these are still potential leak vectors that require appropriate controls. Threat Modeling Is Essential Before deploying any AI application that handles sensitive data, invest time in thorough threat modeling. Map out where data flows through the system, where it's stored (even temporarily), who has access at each stage, and what could go wrong at every step. Ask uncomfortable questions: What happens if a prompt injection succeeds? Could an attacker chain multiple agent tools together to exfiltrate data? Do our logs contain enough information to reconstruct sensitive user conversations? Are we accidentally training on data that includes customer secrets? This exercise is especially critical when using third-party LLM providers that allow limited control over data handling. Understand their data retention policies, training practices, and security controls. Don't assume \"enterprise\" agreements provide adequate protection; verify the specifics and design the integration accordingly. The Bottom Line Data leakage in AI systems isn't a hypothetical risk — it's an architectural challenge that requires intentional design. The convenience and power of AI can easily override security considerations if we're not deliberate about building protections into every layer of our systems. By implementing defense-in-depth strategies and treating sensitive data protection as a core requirement rather than an afterthought, organizations can harness AI's transformative power while maintaining the security and trust their users demand. Start with threat modeling to understand your specific risks, implement controls at your highest-exposure points first, and remember that incremental improvements in data protection are far better than delayed deployment of comprehensive controls. The organizations poised to succeed with AI are those that recognize data protection isn't a constraint on innovation — it's the foundation that makes sustainable innovation possible.
