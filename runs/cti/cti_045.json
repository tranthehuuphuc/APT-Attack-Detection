protection across workforce AI adoption and AI development December 15, 2025 | John Gamble | Securing AI Artificial intelligence is transforming how organizations operate, innovate, and compete. From employees using GenAI tools to boost productivity to engineering teams building sophisticated AI agents and applications, AI has become central to modern business operations. AI now operates across every part of the enterprise, spanning endpoints, applications, identities, cloud services, data, and SaaS platforms. But it also introduces a new attack surface: the prompt and agent interaction layer where models, tools, and non-human identities make decisions and take actions that can be manipulated. Today, CrowdStrike is announcing the general availability of CrowdStrike Falcon® AI Detection and Response (AIDR), extending an industry-leading CrowdStrike Falcon® platform to secure the fastest-growing attack surface in the AI era. With Falcon AIDR, organizations can now protect the critical layer where people, systems, and autonomous agents interact and gain comprehensive security for both workforce AI adoption and AI development at runtime through one unified platform. The New AI Security Imperative: Protecting the Prompt Layer In the AI era, language is an attack vector. Adversaries are using techniques like prompt injection, jailbreaks, and agent manipulation to hijack AI systems, exfiltrate sensitive data, and compromise enterprise security. CrowdStrike researchers are tracking over 180 prompt injection techniques to form the industry's most comprehensive taxonomy of this emerging threat landscape. There is an urgent need to defend the AI attack surface: Nearly half of employees (45%) report using AI tools without informing their manager, creating a shadow AI gap where sensitive data may be exposed or tools can be manipulated. 1 At the same time, engineering teams are rapidly developing homegrown models, agents, and AI workflows, often relying on open-source guardrails or fragmented security tooling that leaves gaps in runtime protection and governance. Traditional security tools were never built to protect AI assets across domains or the new AI interaction layer. With Falcon AIDR, CrowdStrike delivers the industry’s first unified platform that secures every layer of enterprise AI — data, models, agents, identities, infrastructure, and interactions — from development through workforce usage. Introducing Falcon AI Detection and Response Falcon AIDR redefines AI security with comprehensive protection for both employee adoption of generative AI tools and runtime security for homegrown AI development. Built on the AI-native Falcon platform, AIDR provides unified visibility, real-time threat detection, data protection, access controls, and automated response across endpoints, applications, AI agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, AI/API gateways, and cloud environments. Just as CrowdStrike pioneered modern endpoint security with endpoint detection and response (EDR), we’re bringing the same architectural advantage to AI by securing the interaction layer where AI systems reason, execute, and make decisions. Figure 1. The AIDR Visibility dashboard showing AI traffic from users, agents, LLMs, applications, and MCP servers (click to enlarge) Key Capabilities Illuminate Shadow AI and Enforce Governance Falcon AIDR delivers visibility into employee AI tool use. Organizations can map relationships between users, prompts, models, agents, and MCP servers to understand AI usage patterns and identify risky behaviors. With attribute-based access controls, security teams can enforce granular AI security policies across users, agents, tools, and models without introducing unwanted friction to workflows. Comprehensive runtime logs provide audit trails for compliance, forensics, and continuous monitoring. Detect and Stop AI-Specific Threats Falcon AIDR detects and prevents direct and indirect prompt injection, jailbreaks, and model manipulation attempts in real time with high detection efficacy and low latency. The solution identifies malicious indicators of compromise (IOCs) and entities within prompts and AI responses, monitors and validates MCP server communications to prevent unauthorized tool execution, and detects harmful content including toxic content, violence, criminal conduct, and other policy violations across AI prompts and responses. Figure 2. Creating a confidential and PII masking policy to be applied to AI traffic (click to enlarge) Protect Sensitive Data Across AI Interactions Falcon AIDR automatically detects and blocks confidential information including personally identifiable information (PII), secrets, keys, and regulated data before it’s exposed to AI models. Multiple redaction methods are supported, including replacement, masking, partial masking, hash, and format-preserving encryption to protect data while preserving AI workflows. The solution also identifies code in 26 programming languages to prevent intellectual property leakage, and supports custom entity detectors for organization-specific sensitive data types. Investigate and Respond Faster Security teams can enforce real-time policy actions that block unsafe interactions, report violations, and transform sensitive data automatically across browsers, applications, gateways, and MCP proxies. Falcon AIDR findings stream directly to CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM for unified security operations and cross-domain correlation. Interactive visualizations help teams trace attribute-based relationships, monitor metrics, track policy detections, and accelerate investigations with detailed context around AI events. See it in action: Watch this demo to see how Falcon AIDR protects the AI interaction layer in real time: Securing the Complete AI Lifecycle While AIDR focuses on protecting the prompt and agent interaction layer, it's just one part of CrowdStrike's comprehensive approach to securing AI across the entire lifecycle, from development to deployment to enterprise-wide adoption: Development : Identify and secure AI libraries, packages, and models across endpoints and cloud environments. Uncover misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and supply chain risks before they’re weaponized. Conduct AI red teaming and risk assessments to validate resilience before deployment. Runtime : Monitor and record agentic behavior with tamper-proof logs. Defend against prompt injection, excessive agency, and sensitive data leakage. Govern and protect non-human identities with just-in-time access and real-time threat prevention. Adoption : Illuminate shadow AI across the workforce. Enforce AI governance across endpoints, SaaS environments, cloud services, and employee tools. Secure GPTs, agents, and NHIs that traverse enterprise environments. With Falcon AIDR delivered through the Falcon platform, CrowdStrike protects the full AI infrastructure — from the environments where AI runs to the interaction layer where prompts and agents operate. Our unified approach enables organizations to defend the entire AI attack surface, from traditional surfaces like endpoints, cloud workloads, applications, data, and identities to new surfaces including the prompt interaction layer, agentic reasoning and tool execution, autonomous workflows, and cross-model interactions. One Platform for Complete AI Security By consolidating AI security into the Falcon platform, CrowdStrike eliminates the operational overhead and tool sprawl that comes with fragmented or bolt-on solutions. Organizations benefit from: A single lightweight sensor to reduce complexity A unified console delivering a 360° view of AI assets, behaviors, and detections Cross-domain correlation across endpoints, cloud, identity, SaaS, and AI behaviors Agentic response workflows enabling SOC teams to counter AI-powered attacks at machine speed With CrowdStrike, organizations can adopt AI at enterprise scale with protection as fast and adaptive as the technology itself — reducing AI risk without slowing innovation, ensuring compliance and governance across human and non-human identities, securing AI development pipelines, and transforming AI from a security concern into a strategic advantage.
